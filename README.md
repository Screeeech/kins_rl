# Reinforcement Learning 2023 Fall DRP Project

This is an implementation of the TD(0) and Q-learning agent from Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto's Introduction to RL book. The code explores the problem of trying to stack two towers that have some probability of falling over which increases as the stacks get taller.
The agent must learn to figure out the best strategies to stack the blocks while it can only gather data by interacting with the environment. Implements concepts such as importance sampling, n-th visit monte-carlo, SARSA/expected SARSA, TD-learning, and Q-learning.
